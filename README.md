# PostSystem
  The project is designed as a post office system simulator.

#Input
  The system will load three files: wanted.txt, postoffice.txt and commands.txt
  
#Input files descriptions
  wanted.txt contains names forbidden from entering the system.
  Postoffice.txt contains post offices dealing mail/parcel delivery related affairs.
  commands.txt contains commands the simulator simulates.

#Execution
  The simulator executes the commands, prints the result, and also provides a GUI for the user to simulate more post system related actions
